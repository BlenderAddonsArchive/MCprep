MCprep
======

This is a blender python addon to increase workflow for creating minecraft renders and animations, by automatically setting up better materials, importing library models and groups, and setting up proxy characters for animation and default animations for regualr features like grass and leaves.

The forum WIP thread for the development of this addon is found below:
http://www.blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?316151-ADDON-WIP-MCprep-for-Minecraft-Workflow

This addon is made to work with an asset library directory, from which models and groups are linked or imported from. A version of this library is being set up still for others to use.
